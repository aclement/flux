/**
 * An instance of this interface represents a connection to flux message bus.
 * <p>
 * Clients may send messages by calling the 'send' method 
 * and receive messages by adding message handlers. 
 * <p>
 * A connection has the concept of 'channels' which corresponds to a 'user'
 * more or less. Messages in flux are generally intended for, or pertaining to
 * a specific user. By connecting to a user's channel the client becomes elegible
 * to send messages on behalf of this user and receive messages on behalf of the user.
 * <p>
 * Initially when a connection is created it is not connected to any user channel and
 * will only be eligible to send/receive messages that are sent explicitly to all users.
 * <p>
 * Depending on how a IMessageConnector was created, it may have certain priviliges 
 * and limitations. E.g. a typical user may not join any channels but their own 
 * and may only send or receive messages that belong to them, as indicated by
 * the 'username' property in the message.
 * <p>
 * If a client tries doing something it is not allowed to do, then an exception 
 * may be thrown, or the operation can just silently fail.
